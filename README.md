# SafeShare
A secure system for file transfer and more! ALPHA

1. What is this?
  Just another project trying to make your online data more secure.
  
2. How is this different?
  We provide you with a free and secure file sharing platform. However we dont want to remain just a file sharing platform.
  We implement a coin that looks like bitcoin but more reliable and native escrow support.
  We are trying to make a system where you can put your files, put your money, your ideas, your websites, everything. Whilst remaining full control!
  You decide what happens, who has access.

3. Our protocol
  We made (or try to, its babysteps) to make a protocol that will be called: SecuNet.
  SecuNet is fully p2p based and written from scratch. It has advanced (or will have) security, to be honest im not a cryptographic expert. I just use the basics: AES256, TLS1.2, SHA512.
  
4. Can I help?
  Sure! We'd love to see people help us, cant code? No problem! Send us your ideas and maybe we'll implement them :D
  
Note: This readme might be changed later on
Note: We use Titanium Web Proxy as a base for our .secunet sites, check out their awesome repo: <a href="https://github.com/justcoding121/Titanium-Web-Proxy"> Titanium Web Proxy </a>
